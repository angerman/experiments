Duffer.py
=========

A stupider content tracker.

Duffer implements a subset of `git`'s object model (blobs, trees, and commits).
There are currently no plans to support branches, tags, or packfiles.

*Why*

I wanted to give a talk about Git internals with an implementation in Haskell.
Unfortunately, I don't know anything about Git internals or writing nontrivial
programs in Haskell, so I'm writing this first.
